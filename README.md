The Combiez Pokédex is considered an invaluable tool for Trainers in the Pokémon World, providing you with all the information you need to make the most of your adventure in the legendary region of Kanto.

### Are you a promising trainer from Pallet Town?

So, <b>congratulations!</b> All you need to start your path is to register in the <b>Trainers section</b>.



Once you have successfully registered, you will be able to create your own team of up to 6 Pokémons.
<br/>Do you already know with whom you want to share this adventure? Go to the Team page and search for them in the browser. 
<br/>Are you undecided? Do not feel pressured, you can change your mind at any time.



### And what if I was just passing through?

If you are here we assume that it is because you are a nostalgic fan of the original version like us, so do not hesitate to visit our Home page (to maximize the experience, allow the audio in your web browser) or our charming Pokédex section. Feel free to spend as much time as you want.
